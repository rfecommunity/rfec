# Context: Site Navigation (Header / Footer / Logo)
**ID**: FEAT-002
**Category**: features
**Last Updated**: 2026-06-07T00:00:00Z
**Dependencies**: CORE-001, CORE-003
**Description**: The persistent chrome — Header, Footer, Logo — rendered by the site layout.

## Summary
The persistent site chrome (Header, Footer, Logo) is rendered once by `app/(site)/layout.tsx` (CORE-001), wrapping all marketing and content pages. Header now links to the `/eventos` page in addition to the in-page anchors. Footer also includes an `/eventos` link. Navigation mixes anchor-based links (single-page sections) and full routes (events). `Logo` is a shared brand mark used by both components.

## Key Information
- **`components/header.tsx`** — top navigation bar. Renders the RFEC logo and a nav with: a `/eventos` link (Button variant `link`) and a `/#join` CTA ("Faça Parte"). Sticky, `z-30`.
- **`components/footer.tsx`** — site footer; community links including `/eventos`, `/#about`, `/#mission`, `/#join`, `/#partners`; social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, email); copyright.
- **`components/logo.tsx`** — brand mark component reused by header/footer.
- **Placement rule**: chrome belongs in `app/(site)/layout.tsx` (the route group layout), **not** in the root `app/layout.tsx`. This keeps the Studio (`/studio`) and API routes (`/api/*`) free of marketing chrome.
- **Anchor navigation**: links target section `id`s (e.g. `/#partners`) or full routes (e.g. `/eventos`). When adding nav entries, ensure anchored sections set matching `id`s.
