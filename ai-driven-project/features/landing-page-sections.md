# Context: Landing Page Sections
**ID**: FEAT-001
**Category**: features
**Last Updated**: 2026-06-07T00:00:00Z
**Dependencies**: CORE-001, CORE-003
**Description**: The page-block components (Hero, WhoWeAre, Mission, Join) and the title-with-tag helper.

## Summary
Each landing-page block is one component in `components/` (no `ui/` subfolder). They are stacked by `app/page.tsx` (CORE-001). All user-facing copy is Portuguese (`pt-BR`). Sections are mostly server components rendering static marketing content with Tailwind utilities.

## Key Information
- **`components/hero.tsx`** — top hero block (headline + intro). First section on the page.
- **`components/who-we-are.tsx`** — "Quem somos" block; describes the community.
- **`components/mission.tsx`** — mission/values block.
- **`components/join.tsx`** — call-to-action to join the community (links/buttons).
- **`components/title-with-tag.tsx`** — small shared presentational helper that renders a section title with a decorative tag/eyebrow; reused across sections. Accepts `className` + children.
- **Partners** is its own context (FEAT-003) because it adds a client-side carousel.
- **Conventions**: each section is a default-exported function component; uses Tailwind classes (token-backed); wraps content in a centered container; ids on `<section>` enable in-page anchor navigation (see FEAT-002).
- **Editing copy**: change text directly in the section component — there is no CMS or i18n dictionary; copy is inline Portuguese.
